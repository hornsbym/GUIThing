roomDict = {"Blair's Room":"You are in a narrow room dug out of the ice. It is dimly lit; one lamp sits in the center of \
the room, casting a weak blue light over everything. There is a door, chained shut, along the far wall. Approaching the \
door, you see there is a small opening to look through. Inside, you find a short, pudgy man huddled in front of a computer \
screen. Blair.","Dining Room":"You find yourself in a large, warm room. A small generator hums in the corner; beside \
it sits an electric heater. A long table sits in the center of the room. Its chairs are all turned the wrong way and \
lined up in rows. Clearly, there has recently been an important meeting here.","Kitchen":"The make-shift space barely \
qualifies as a kitchen. It is dark, cold and dirty. Dirty plates are scattered piled on one of the wooden counters, and \
the remains of last night's meal lay decaying on the carving table. The smell is almost too much to bear.",'Experiment \
